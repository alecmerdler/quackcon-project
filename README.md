Android client app for QuackCon hackathon

This Android application utilizes the Eclipse Paho MQTT client to connect to a message broker which is dispatching messages 
containing a unique publisher device id, and an intensity. The app will then provide haptic feedback by vibrating according
to the specified intensity.
